\section{Adding Features to LibreCAD v3}
During my 6 weeks training, I worked upon open source, learned a lot from it and in return contributed to it. LibreCAD v3 is written in C++ using Qt framework. It is a Qt application. With this project, I aimed at understanding C++ more clearly and deeply.\\
I added these features in LibreCAD v3's User Interface:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open
\item Save 
\item Save As
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Open}
In this, I added Open feature to LibreCAD v3. This adds a button to the User Interface. When it is clicked, it prompts for a file to be opened. Then choose existing file and click "open". The file will be opened.\\

\subsubsection{Save As}[!ht]
In this feature, when user clicks on "Save As" button, it prompts for a file location on which the file is to be saved.

\subsubsection{Save}
In this feature, when user clicks on save button, it saves the script. It saves the changes to the existing file.
